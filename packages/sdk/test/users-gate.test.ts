/*
 * The root record is two kinds of key.

 * `defaultShell` is the person's - the host's own note by `rootConfig` says so,
 * and names VS Code pushing it on connect - so it lives on the connection and
 * reaches only the terminals that connection opens. Everything else describes
 * the host and is still one setting for everybody.
 *
 * That is also what retires the rule that setting it needed `terminal`: a
 * preference nobody else reads cannot aim anybody else's shell, and the paths
 * with no connection in hand (a `!command`, and the factory a backend opens a
 * terminal with) take the daemon's own shell and no person's at all.
