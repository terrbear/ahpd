/**
 * The host: the protocol, and the parts to build your own out of.
 *
 * There is no backend in here, and that is the point of it being its own
 * package. `rpc` is JSON-RPC and holds no socket, `listen` is the only file
 * that knows which runtime it is on, and `createHost` is the protocol and
 * imports nothing that runs an agent. A harness is an `Agent` handed to
 * `createHost` from outside - `@ahpd/agent-claude` is one, `examples/` has one
 * written from nothing - and adding another is not a fork of this.
 *
 * Anything that touches the machine is the same shape again: `fileResources`
 * reads files, `shellTerminals` spawns shells and `gitBranches` spawns `git`,
 * and all three are passed to `createHost` rather than reached for by it. So
 * the protocol imports no runtime, and a host without one of them refuses the
 * commands it cannot answer instead of pretending to.
 *
 * Every shape lives in `types/` and nothing there imports a runtime value, so
 * the contract can be read without loading any of this.
 *
 * A plugin contributes this same option object rather than a second kind of
 * thing: `foldHostOptions` composes several plugins' contributions into one
 * `HostOptions`, and `PluginHost` in `types/plugin.ts` is those options named
 * back.
