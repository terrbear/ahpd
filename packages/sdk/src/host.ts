/**
 * The protocol server: channels, subscriptions, requests and state actions.
 *
 * One host serves many connections. It owns the session catalogue, the live
 * sessions and the sequence number that orders everything it emits.
 *
 * Rules that govern anything answering AHP:
 *
 * - `serverSeq` advances when state changes, not per message. A snapshot is
 *   taken at a sequence number and every action after it carries a greater
 *   one, which is how a client knows it missed nothing.
 * - Notifications carry no id and get no reply. `unsubscribe` and
 *   `dispatchAction` are notifications.
 * - Subscriptions are per connection. Dropping one client's subscription must
 *   not affect another's.
 * - Only client-dispatchable actions are accepted from clients; the rest are
 *   the host reporting what it did.
