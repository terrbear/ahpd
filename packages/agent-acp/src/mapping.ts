/**
 * The one place a `session/update` becomes an AHP `chat/*` action.
 *
 * Every notification a server sends arrives here, and every decision about
 * what it means on the wire is made here, so a change in the ACP update union
 * is one edit in one file. `session.ts` iterates what this returns and sends
 * it; it makes no choices of its own about an update.
 *
 * The protocol requires a part to exist before text streams into it, so this
 * file opens a markdown or reasoning part at the first chunk of each run of
 * that kind, a markdown run at its first chunk holding more than whitespace,
 * and a turn's parts land in the order the server wrote them. An
 * update this bridge does not understand returns nothing rather than
 * throwing, so a 1.5 server does not fail a 1.4 bridge.
