/**
 * One ACP session, seen through the AHP `Session` contract.
 *
 * The host owns the channels and the sequence numbers; this owns the state
 * they carry, one spawned ACP server behind a turn, and the translation of
 * that server's notifications into the `chat/*` actions a client already
 * knows. The update-to-action decisions themselves live in `mapping.ts`; this
 * file is the lifecycle around them, and the connection in `connection.ts`.
 *
 * Rules the protocol requires of anything emitting chat actions, kept here the
 * way the other backends keep them:
 *
 * - `chat/turnStarted` comes first, then a response part is opened, and only
 *   then may a delta stream into it.
 * - The running turn is `active` and is not in `turns`; it moves there when it
 *   completes.
 * - A turn carries both sides: `message.text` is what was said and
 *   `responseParts` is what the agent answered.
 *
 * A member this task cannot honestly support - a fork, a rewind, a live config
 * swap, a permission question - is left out or answered with the empty answer
 * the interface documents. Nothing throws over a capability this bridge does
 * not have yet.
