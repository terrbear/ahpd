![Agent Host Protocol 0.9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AHP-0.9.0-0b7285)

An [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) backend for [`@ahpd/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/sdk), and a plugin for the [`@ahpd/server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/server) daemon.

Any program that speaks ACP over its stdio is one configured command, not a package of its own, so `copilot --acp`, `codex-acp`, `gemini --experimental-acp` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-acp` all run through this one package.

Part of [ahpd](https://github.com/softov/ahpd). The source is in [`packages/agent-acp`](https://github.com/softov/ahpd/tree/main/packages/agent-acp).

## In the daemon

```bash
ahpd plugin install @ahpd/agent-acp
```

Then add one entry per ACP server to `plugins` in the daemon's `config.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "@ahpd/agent-acp",
      "options": { "provider": "copilot", "displayName": "Copilot", "command": "copilot", "args": ["--acp"] }
    },
    {
      "name": "@ahpd/agent-acp",
      "options": { "provider": "codex", "displayName": "Codex", "command": "codex-acp" }
    }
  ]
}
```

The command has to be on the daemon's `PATH`. The `codex` CLI has no ACP mode of its own; `codex-acp` comes from `npm i -g @agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`. A command that is missing fails that provider's turns with a message and leaves the daemon running.

## In your own host

```bash
pnpm add @ahpd/agent-acp @ahpd/sdk
```

```ts
import { createHost, listen } from '@ahpd/sdk';
import { acpAgent } from '@ahpd/agent-acp';

const path = process.cwd();
const host = createHost({
  path,
  agents: [
    acpAgent({ provider: 'copilot', displayName: 'Copilot', command: 'copilot', args: ['--acp'] }),
  ],
});
await listen({ port: 9187 }, (peer) => host.accept(peer));
```

`createHost` takes a list of agents, so several ACP servers run beside each other and beside any other backend.

## Options

| option | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `command` | required | the program to spawn as the ACP server |
| `args` | | the arguments to give it |
| `env` | | environment variables merged over `process.env` for the child |
| `cwd` | | the directory the server runs in; the session's working directory when absent |
| `provider` | | the AHP provider id, default `acp` |
| `displayName` | | what a client reads instead of the id, default `ACP` |
| `description` | | one line about what this backend is |
| `model` | | the model a session that names none runs on |
| `hostTools` | | give each session the host's tools and its clients' tools as an HTTP MCP server; default on, skipped for a server that takes no http MCP servers |

## What it does

It spawns the command, completes the ACP handshake over its stdio, opens one session, and turns each `session/update` into the `chat/*` action a client already knows. A turn ends as `chat/turnComplete` or `chat/turnCancelled` from the server's own stop reason, and `cancel` reaches the server as its notification.

A `session/request_permission` is a confirmation offering the server's own options, approvals first, and the one the person picks is the `optionId` the server receives. An answer that picked none selects the server's once option of that kind, never an `always`.
