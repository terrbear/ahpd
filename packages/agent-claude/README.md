Claude Code as a backend for [`@ahpd/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/sdk), and the plugin that lets the [`@ahpd/server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/server) daemon run it.

Part of [ahpd](https://github.com/softov/ahpd). The source is in [`packages/agent-claude`](https://github.com/softov/ahpd/tree/main/packages/agent-claude).

## In the daemon

Install it where the daemon resolves a plugin name from, and name it:

```bash
ahpd plugin install @ahpd/agent-claude
ahpd --plugin @ahpd/agent-claude
```

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@ahpd/agent-claude"]
}
```

It takes no options in the ordinary install: it catalogues whatever directories the daemon was started on. A configuration may narrow or rename that:

| option | |
| --- | --- |
| `paths` | the directories it catalogues, and where a session goes by default. Defaults to the host's |
| `provider` | the id clients name. `claude` unless something else already is |
| `displayName` | what a client reads instead of the id. `Claude Code` by default |
| `models` | the models the picker offers, in place of the CLI's: a model id, `{ "id", "name" }`, or `{ "fetch": "<url>", "match": "<pattern>", "key": { "fromEnv": "NAME" } }`, which reads an OpenAI-shaped model list and keeps the ids the pattern covers (`*` is any run of characters). A fetch that fails is logged and offers nothing |
| `keepCliModels` | with `models`, add them to the CLI's list rather than replace it |
| `computerExecutable` | where the CLI is *inside a machine*. `claude` on the image's PATH by default |
| `computerConfigDir` | the configuration directory the CLI reads *inside a machine*. `/ahpd/claude` by default; `false` leaves the image's own |
| `workerStop` | what a stop given in a subagent's chat stops. `worker` by default, which stops that subagent and lets the turn that started it go on; `session` cancels that turn instead |
| `presets` | named sets of Claude options, by name. One is what every session runs on; two or more offer a session a choice, and the first is the default |

### Presets

A preset is a set of Claude options an operator writes once and sessions run on, rather than options each session offers a control for. Two of them give a session a `preset` to choose from, fixed when the session is created:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    { "name": "@ahpd/agent-claude", "options": {
      "presets": {
        "work": { "thinking": "adaptive", "sandbox": "on" },
        "read-only": { "thinking": "disabled", "sandbox": "on", "outputStyle": "concise" }
      }
    } }
  ]
}
```

A preset holds five fields, and each is checked when the plugin loads, so a preset that names anything else is the daemon refusing this package rather than a session quietly running on something nobody wrote:

| field | |
| --- | --- |
| `sandbox` | the CLI's own sandbox for shell commands: `default` leaves it to the settings files, `on` and `off` set it |
| `thinking` | extended thinking: `adaptive` lets the agent decide when to think, `disabled` is none |
| `outputStyle` | the name of a style from the CLI's own settings |
| `env` | variables for the CLI's process, laid over the daemon's own environment. A value is a string, `null` to unset the variable, or `{ "fromEnv": "NAME" }` for the daemon's own `NAME`, which must be set when the plugin loads |
| `extraArgs` | arguments the CLI is started with beyond the ones this backend builds, by name without the `--`, and `null` for a flag that takes none |

With one preset there is nothing to choose and every session runs on it; with none, a session runs on what this backend has always run on, which is `thinking: "adaptive"` and no sandbox layer. The first preset is the default in both senses, and a session whose own stored `preset` names one that has since been renamed or removed runs on the first, which is what is left of a choice that no longer resolves.

A client may set the session's `shellXdgConfigHome` to the user's `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. An empty string unsets it for Claude's Bash tool, letting tools use `HOME/.config`. The setting changes only Bash commands; the daemon and Claude CLI keep their own environment, including any private XDG directory from the launcher or provider preset. If the client does not send it, Bash keeps the inherited XDG value. Host-managed terminals accept the same setting per connection through `root/configChanged`.

### A second Claude on another endpoint

Load the package twice, the second time under its own `provider` and `displayName` and with one preset that points the CLI elsewhere. It is listed as a harness of its own, and the key stays in the daemon's environment:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "@ahpd/agent-claude",
    { "name": "@ahpd/agent-claude", "options": {
      "provider": "claude-openrouter",
      "displayName": "Claude Code (OpenRouter)",
      "models": [
        "stealth/space-bunny-alpha",
        { "fetch": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models", "match": "anthropic/*" }
      ],
      "presets": {
        "openrouter": { "env": {
          "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://openrouter.ai/api",
          "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": { "fromEnv": "OPENROUTER_API_KEY" },
          "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "",
          "ANTHROPIC_MODEL": "stealth/space-bunny-alpha",
          "ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL": "stealth/space-bunny-alpha"
        } }
      }
    } }
  ]
}
```

## In your own host

```bash
pnpm add @ahpd/agent-claude @ahpd/sdk @microsoft/agent-host-protocol
```

```ts
import { createHost, listen } from '@ahpd/sdk';
import { claude } from '@ahpd/agent-claude';

const path = process.cwd();
const host = createHost({ path, agents: [claude({ paths: [path] })] });
await listen({ port: 9187 }, (peer) => host.accept(peer));
```

`createHost` takes a list of agents, so this can run alongside other backends. The plugin entry wraps the same `claude()`.

## What it does

It starts the [Claude agent SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk), converts its message stream into AHP state actions, and reads Claude's transcript files.

| export | |
| --- | --- |
| `claude(options)` | the `Agent` to pass to `createHost` |
| `createSession(options)` | one live session |
| `catalogue(dir)` | Claude's sessions in a directory, as rows a host can list |
| `turnsOf(sessionId, dir)` | a past session read from its transcript, as turns |
| `subagentsOf(sessionId, dir, turns)` | the subagent chats a past session ran, linked to the calls that spawned them |
| `probe(options)` | runs a CLI at startup to read the available models and commands |
| `apply(host, options)` | the plugin entry, with `name` and `title` beside it |

## Supported

Turns and streaming, tool calls and approvals, questions from the agent, model and effort selection, permission modes, MCP servers and OAuth sign-in, skills and slash commands, multiple chats per session, forking a chat from a turn, truncating a chat back to a turn, session titles, token usage, and context compaction.

An approval offers Allow once, an "always" choice and Deny when the SDK suggests a permission to keep for the call. The "always" choice is labelled by what the suggestions do, and picking it returns them to the SDK as `updatedPermissions`. With no suggestion, the approval is approve or deny.

A subagent Claude runs is its own chat. Every `Task` and `Agent` call opens one through the host's `Start.subagent`, read-only and named `ahp-chat://subagent/…`, and the subagent's text, thinking, tool calls and permission asks are drawn there instead of in the turn that spawned it. A stop given in the subagent's chat stops that subagent through the SDK's `stopTask`, and the turn that started it goes on and sees the call end. With `workerStop: "session"`, or before Claude has named the subagent's task, it cancels that turn instead. On a host without `Start.subagent` the subagent's output stays inline. A session read back from disk rebuilds each subagent's chat from the CLI's `subagents/*.meta.json` and `.jsonl` files.

Sessions the host is not running are read from Claude's transcripts, so clients can browse and read them without starting a process. The agent starts when a turn is sent.

## Credentials

Sessions use whatever the Claude CLI is signed in with. A client can push a token instead. Pushed tokens are held per connection and are not used for other clients' sessions.
