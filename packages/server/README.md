![Agent Host Protocol 0.9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AHP-0.9.0-0b7285)

A ready-to-run [Agent Host Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/agent-host-protocol/) server. It installs the `ahpd` command, runs agent sessions, and serves them over a WebSocket, so several clients can watch and drive the same session at once.

Part of [ahpd](https://github.com/softov/ahpd). The source is in [`packages/server`](https://github.com/softov/ahpd/tree/main/packages/server), and it is built on [`@ahpd/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/sdk).

It bundles no agent. Every backend is a plugin you install beside it:

- [`@ahpd/agent-claude`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/agent-claude): Claude Code, through the Claude Agent SDK.
- [`@ahpd/agent-acp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/agent-acp): any [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) server, one provider per configured command.
- [`@ahpd/agent-cofold`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/agent-cofold): any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, through the cofold runtime.
- [`@ahpd/agent-pi`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahpd/agent-pi): the pi coding agent, embedded in the daemon.

A daemon with no backend refuses to start and says how to install one. To serve another agent, write an `Agent` and load it the same way: see [docs/AGENT.md](https://github.com/softov/ahpd/blob/main/docs/AGENT.md) and [docs/PLUGINS.md](https://github.com/softov/ahpd/blob/main/docs/PLUGINS.md).

## Install

The daemon, and a backend for it to serve:

```bash
npm i -g @ahpd/server
ahpd plugin install @ahpd/agent-claude
ahpd --plugin @ahpd/agent-claude --path /work/project
```

`ahpd plugin install` runs `npm install` in the configuration directory, where a bare plugin name is resolved from, and adds the name to `plugins` in `config.json` so the next run loads it. A plugin installed with `npm i -g` is not seen.

To upgrade, run `npm i -g @ahpd/server`, then `ahpd plugin update all` to move every installed plugin to the daemon's version (or `ahpd plugin update <name>...` for only some), then restart the daemon. ahpd installs the daemon's own `@ahpd/sdk` beside the plugins, so one plugin never blocks another, and a plugin whose `@ahpd/sdk` range leaves out the daemon's is refused when the daemon loads it.

npm 12 blocks install scripts unless told otherwise, and `node-pty` needs its script on Linux to build the terminal binding. Without it the daemon still runs, but terminals fall back to pipes (`isPty: false`). Add `--allow-scripts=node-pty` to the daemon's global install, or run `npm config set allow-scripts=node-pty --location=user` once.

It listens on `ws://127.0.0.1:9187`. Run it with no arguments to serve the directory you are in.

Needs Node 22 or later. Also runs on Bun and Deno.

## Commands

```
ahpd [options]              run it in this terminal
ahpd start [options]        run it in the background
ahpd stop                   stop the background one
ahpd status                 say whether one is running, and where
ahpd config                 print the config file path and its contents
ahpd plugin install <name>  install a plugin and add it to the config
ahpd plugin list            list the configured plugins
ahpd plugin update all      move every installed plugin to the daemon's version
ahpd plugin update <name>   move only the plugins named
```

`start` runs the same program detached. It writes its output to `daemon.log` and its pid and URL to `daemon.json`, both next to the config, which is where `status` reads from.

## Options

| flag | |
| --- | --- |
| `--port <n>` | Default `9187`. Use `0` for a free port |
| `--host <addr>` | Default `127.0.0.1`. Use `0.0.0.0` to accept remote connections, which requires a token |
| `--path <dir>` | A directory to serve. Repeatable. Defaults to the working directory |
| `--plugin <name>` | A plugin to load. Repeatable, and replaces the config file's list |
| `--connection-token <secret>` | Require this secret on every connection |
| `--connection-token-file <p>` | Require the secret in this file. Writes a new one if the file is missing |
| `--without-connection-token` | Accept any connection |
| `--config-file <p>` | Use this config file instead of the default |
| `--automations <where>` | `file`, the default, keeps them beside the config and fires their schedules. `memory` keeps them until the process ends and fires nothing |
| `--sessions <where>` | Where the read and archived bits and a session's settings go. `file`, the default, keeps them beside the config. `memory` forgets them when the process ends |
| `--version`, `-v` | What version this is |
| `--help`, `-h` | |

Every flag except `--version` and `--help` also has a key in `config.json` under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ahpd`, spelled the same way without the dashes. A flag beats the file. Run `ahpd config` to see the path and the current values.

If the service uses a private `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, set `AHPD_SHELL_XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in its environment to the user's config directory for agent Bash commands and host-managed terminals. Set it to an empty string to unset `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in those shells, which makes tools use their usual `HOME/.config` location. The daemon and Claude CLI keep their private environment. An explicit client shell setting takes precedence, and without either setting shells inherit the daemon's XDG value.

## Directories

`--path` is repeatable:

```bash
ahpd --path ~/src/project-a --path ~/src/project-b
```

The first is the default, and it is what a client gets when it names no directory. A directory that was not named is refused.

## Remote connections

It binds to loopback and needs no token there. Binding anywhere else does:

```bash
ahpd --host 0.0.0.0 --connection-token <secret>
```

Or keep the secret in a file, which is written with a fresh one if it is not there yet:

```bash
ahpd --host 0.0.0.0 --connection-token-file ~/.config/ahpd/token
```

Clients present it as `?tkn=<secret>` on the URL or as an `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` header.

`--without-connection-token` binds without one. Only use it when something else already keeps the port private.

## What it serves

Sessions, chats and turns with streaming responses, tool calls and approvals, questions from the agent, file reads and writes, a shell as a terminal channel, git branches and changesets, sessions in their own worktree, scheduled automations, and OTLP telemetry. Each backend adds its own: models, permission modes, commands, and past sessions read from its own files.

## Connecting

Any AHP client works. [`ahpc`](https://github.com/softov/ahpc) is one:

```bash
ahpc --host ws://127.0.0.1:9187
```

## Provider account identity

An admitted AHP client can read `ahpd-account://<provider>` on `ahp-root://` with `resourceRead`. The UTF-8 JSON response is either `{"status":"verified","name":"user@example.com"}` or `{"status":"unavailable"}`. The resource is read only and returns no tokens, raw authentication responses, or probe errors.

Append `?cwd=<URL-encoded absolute path>` to probe a new session's selected working directory. Codex requires that path and must use the configured `codex-acp` command; ahpd accepts only its ChatGPT account-status notification. API key status, missing status, and configured credential environment overrides return `unavailable`. Claude Code probes `claude auth status --json` as the daemon user from the selected directory, and returns `unavailable` for key, gateway, cloud mode, or preset overrides. A session using a machine or client-supplied credential can have a different account from the daemon default; clients selecting those overrides must show this identity as unavailable for that session.

## Embedding

The daemon is `@ahpd/sdk`, the plugins its config names, and a socket. The same host in your own program:

```ts
import { createHost, listen } from '@ahpd/sdk';
import { claude } from '@ahpd/agent-claude';

const host = createHost({ path, agents: [claude({ paths: [path] })] });
await listen({ port: 9187 }, (peer) => host.accept(peer));
```

For a host of a different shape, build it from `@ahpd/sdk` and skip this package.
